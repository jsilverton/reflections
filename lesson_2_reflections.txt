Reflect: Initializing a Repository
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It adds .git folder with a lot of files.
So GIT knows it's a GIT repository, and can configure it before 1st commit?

Reflect: Staging Area
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- staging area is something tracked by GIT, working directory is not tracked by GIT
- it means can have version control operating on your files without having to change the master

Reflect: Commit Size
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Not sure - does every subcommit that you make to staging area get recorded? In which case, could stage little and often

Reflect: When to Use Branches
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
could keep all logical large changes on a branch rather than the master, until ready to commit the whole lot. Multiple people working on the same code base could use branching.
